One thing that many other answers are missing is how to detach a running process that currently blocks the shell. In most terminals and shells, Ctrl+Z will halt the running process and bring you back to an input prompt. Then, you can issue

bg

to send the running process into the background. Issue

fg

instead to put the running process back into the foreground.
